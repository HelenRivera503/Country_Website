      <p>The history of Spain is a story of the rise and fall of one of the largest empires in the world. Spain emerged as a unified state in 1492, when the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon conquered the last Muslim territory in the south, the Emirate of Granada. That same year, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas, opening the way for Spanish colonization and exploitation of much of South and Central America. Spain's power and wealth declined from the 17th century onwards, especially after losing its American colonies in the 19th century.

		<p>Spain is bordered to the west by Portugal; to the northeast it borders France, from which it is separated by the tiny principality of Andorra and by the great wall of the Pyrenees Mountains. Spain’s only other land border is in the far south with Gibraltar, an enclave that belonged to Spain until 1713, when it was ceded to Great Britain in the Treaty of Utrecht at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. Elsewhere the country is bounded by water: by the Mediterranean Sea to the east and southeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to the northwest and southwest, and by the Bay of Biscay (an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean) to the north. The Canary (Canarias) Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwestern African mainland, and the Balearic (Baleares) Islands, in the Mediterranean, also are parts of Spain, as are Ceuta and Melilla, two small enclaves in North Africa (northern Morocco) that Spain has ruled for centuries.
